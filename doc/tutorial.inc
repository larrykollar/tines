		i(2,"Tines is an outliner, a planner, an organizer, and a notebook. It is based on the old hnb (hierarchical notebook) software, originally written and maintained by Oyvind Kolas. Larry Kollar (lkollar@gmail.com) currently maintains Tines.",0);
		i(2,"You can use Tines as a straight outliner, editing individual files in OPML, hnb (a simple XML format), or tab-indented text formats.",0);
		i(2,"A more powerful way to use Tines is to keep all your working outlines, project notes, and calendar entries in a single file. If you do not specify a file name when starting Tines, it uses .hnb (soon to be .tines).",0);
